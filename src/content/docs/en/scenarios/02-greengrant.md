## Background

> Based on the story of the films titled [Coming to America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_to_America) and [Coming to America 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_2_America)

After the death of King Jaffe Jofer, his son Akeem took the throne of Zamunda. However, listening to the voice of the times, King Akeem decided to involve his daughter Meeka in the reign.

Meeka wants to use modern tools to bring prosperity to Zamunda. She recognized that the key to development is digital transformation: independent IT infrastructure and digital government, combined with the use of renewable energy sources and climate-friendly solutions.

This digital transformation program is called the Zamunda Digital Renaissance (ZDR).

### General requirements of the ZDR program

- Since this is a government program, it is very important that all projects are accompanied by documentation of sufficient quantity and quality.
- Zamunda is not a poor country, but it does not want to waste money unnecessarily: projects must be planned with economy in mind. Climate-friendly goals also require this!
- It should be noted that internet coverage is not perfect in certain areas of the country. Even where there is internet, there may be higher delays and lower bandwidths.

## Description

In addition to digital transformation, the ZDR program also supports the country's sustainability goals. A key component of this is an online support portal through which individuals and businesses can apply for government subsidies for green investments.

### Real world example

Consider [nffku.hu](https://nffku.hu), operated by the Hungarian National Energy Agency.

## Users

- All citizens of Zamunda, approximately 10 million people.
- Businesses operating in Zamunda, approximately 1 million businesses.
- Administrators in the Zamunda public administration.

## Requirements

- Data protection considerations are of paramount importance:
  - Data processed by the system must be stored within Zamunda's territory, and the system must be operated within Zamunda's territory.
- Each grant application consists of a specific framework, required documentation, and the amount of money that can be requested per application. The following dates are also specified: the opening date of the application and the deadline for submitting applications.
- Administrators can post new applications with unique conditions and scoring systems for each application, as well as the required documents.
- While some applications target smaller segments, many applications can expect a significant number of applicants who want to apply immediately when the application opens so that the budget is not exhausted.
- Applicants must be provided with a web interface that also works properly on mobile devices.
- Administrators must be provided with a web interface.
- Integration with the MundaMail API is required; applicants must be notified of the final outcome of the evaluation through this API.
- Since a significant amount of documentation must be reviewed in order to evaluate applications, it would be beneficial to assist administrators with some kind of AI-based tool.
